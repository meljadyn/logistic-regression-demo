# Logistic Regression Application

This project uses a dataset on individuals with and without diagnosed diabetes and uses a 
linear regression machine learning model to predict whether an individual has diabetes. 

This predictive model has an 87.3% accuracy rate as measured using carefully a carefully split 
training and testing data set.

It also features a variety of data visualizations in the Visualizations tab that were created with
matplotlib and seaborn.

This is my first machine learning project, and I look forward to experimenting with more of them
in the future.
